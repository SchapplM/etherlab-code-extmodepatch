Motivation

    ----- Extract from MathWorks' Website on Simulink Coder: ----
    Simulink Coder (formerly Real-Time Workshop) generates and executes C and
    C++ code from Simulink diagrams, Stateflow charts, and MATLAB functions.
    The generated source code can be used for real-time and non real time
    applications, including simulation acceleration, rapid prototyping, and
    hardware-in-the-loop testing. You can tune and monitor the generated code
    using Simulink or run and interact with the code outside MATLAB and
    Simulink.
    (http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder/index.html)
    -------------------------------------------------------------
 
    First and foremost, Simulink Coder generates C/C++ code from Simulink
    diagrams. This generated code is generic in the sense that a support
    framework is required to make it run.  Typically this framework is
    provided for the targets on which the executable will run. The framework
    ensures execution (maybe in real time), possible interaction with signals
    and parameters, and real world input and output with sensors and
    actuators.
 
    Simulink Coder comes with a generic real time target (grt). This target
    creates an executable that runs on Linux for example. However, neither
    Simulink nor Simulink Coder blockset supply sources or sinks to interact
    with real world sensors. The generated executable does not run in real
    time and interaction with signals and parameters are limited to External
    Mode Communication within the Simulink diagram.
 
    PdServ is a library that facilitates interaction with another process
    using shared memory only. No system calls are used between the library and
    its process. System calls are a major stumbling block real time
    applications have to deal with.
 
    EtherLab is a target for Simulink Coder to generate an executable that
    works with PdServ. Thus the executable has all the possibilities PdServ
    has.
    
    EtherLab also supplies an extensive blockset to interact with the real
    world from within the Simulink diagram. Most importantly, it works very
    closely with EtherCAT. This opens a enormous range of IO devices that can
    be used at the diagram level.

Installation

    From Debian or rpm package:
        Install the package.

        This installs the package into /usr/share/etherlab

    From source files:
    You need:
        - the source tarball
        - installed pdserv environment (not a prerequisite, but is required
          when the executable is generated)
        - cmake, version 2.6 or higher
    Here it goes:
        $ tar xfj etherlab-X.Y.Z.tgz
        $ cd etherlab-X.Y.Z
        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ cmake ..
        $ sudo make install

    This installs the package into /usr/local/share/etherlab

    Once installed, the files need to be copied to MATLAB and configured
    before use. See the next section.

    Power users:
        The files are installed into the data directory as defined by cmake
        for your platform. The default data directory is:
        ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/${DATAROOTDIR}/${TARGETDIR}

        where the defaults are:
          CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = /usr/local
          DATAROOTDIR = share
          TARGETDIR = etherlab

        Thus, by default your files are installed to
        /usr/local/share/etherlab

        To install more than one EtherLab version simultaneously, use the
        TARGETDIR variable when configuring:
        $ cmake -DTARGETDIR=etherlab_Vxx ..
        for example. This will install to /usr/local/share/etherlab_Vxx

        You can also change the variables CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and
        DATAROOTDIR, but this is usually not required.

Configuration

    This section uses MATLAB_ROOT as a generic variable that points to the
    head of the MATLAB installation. Either you know it by heart, or call
    >> matlabroot
    from MATLAB's command line.

    Regardless whether you install using a package manager or from source
    code, another two steps are required before EtherLab can be used:

    1) Copy the files from the installation path to MATLAB:

        This is done with a script:
        # /usr/share/etherlab/install.sh $(MATLAB_ROOT)
        or (from source install):
        # /usr/local/share/etherlab/install.sh $(MATLAB_ROOT)

        The files are copied to $(MATLAB_ROOT)/rtw/c/etherlab. Make sure this
        directory is writeable by you.

    2) Compile the files to be used by MATLAB:
        Start MATLAB and call:
        >> run(fullfile(matlabroot, 'rtw/c/etherlab', 'setup_etherlab.m'))

        This configures the package for use with Simulink. As it compiles mex
        functions, make sure that directories below
        $(MATLAB_ROOT)/rtw/c/etherlab/ are writeable by the matlab user.

        During configuration, paths are added to matlabpath and saved to
        ($(MATLAB_ROOT)/toolbox/local/pathdef.m). Make sure it is writeable.


    Power users:
        The default installation directory of the files in MATLAB is:
        $(MATLAB_ROOT)/rtw/c/etherlab, where the last directory can be
        changed by using the optional second parameter when calling install.sh:
        $ /usr/local/share/etherlab/install.sh $(MATLAB_ROOT) etherlab_Vxx

        This will install to $(MATLAB_ROOT)/rtw/c/etherlab_Vxx

        Using this feature, many parallel installations of EtherLab is
        possible. To switch between them, call:
        >> switch_etherlab('etherlab_Vxx')
        from MATLAB. This will change matlabpath to point to the new
        directory!

        Of coarse (as a power user), you know how to adapt the run()
        command in step 2) above appropriately.

Using EtherLab

    Now open a Simulink diagram. From the diagram, open the Configuration
    Parameters (Menu: Simulation -> Configuration Parameters, or press Ctrl-E
    from within the Simulink diagram). Choose Code Generation tab, and select
    "etherlab.tlc" for System target file. Go to the Solver tab and choose a
    Fixed-step size, such as 0.001. Select the appropriate solver and a
    Tasking mode (SingleTasking or MultiTasking) for your application. Go back
    to the Code Generation tab and press Build button (Pressing Ctrl-B from
    within the diagram also works). Voil√†, you have an executable! Call it and
    be happy.

Using EtherLab in a hosted environment (power users)

    MATLAB, Simulink and Simulink Coder is a significant financial investment
    that is typically installed only on a limited number of systems. These
    licenses are definitely NOT required to run the executable.
    
    While it is easy to transfer the generated executable to a system with a
    similar runtime environment as that of the host (of coarse, including
    pdserv and possibly EtherCAT libraries), you may have the requirement to
    generate only C/C++ code with the MATLAB installation and build the
    executable on another machine. This is for instance when MATLAB is
    installed on a Windows machine while your target will run on Linux.
    
    In this case, select "Generate code only" from the "Code Generation" tab
    of the Configuration Parameters.

    Now copy the directory <model>_etl_hrt to the target machine. Also copy
    the following files from your MATLAB installation:
            ${MATLAB_ROOT}/extern/include
            ${MATLAB_ROOT}/simulink/include/
            ${MATLAB_ROOT}/rtw/c/src/
            ${MATLAB_ROOT}/rtw/c/tools/
    to the target using the same directory structure.

    Dive into the directory containing <model>_etl_hrt -- not into the
    directory <model>_etl_hrt itself. Type
    $ make -C <model>_etl_hrt -f <model>.mk \
                MATLAB_DIR=$(MATLAB_ROOT) \
                ETHERLAB_DIR=/usr/local/share/etherlab
    and there you go! (MATLAB_DIR and/or ETHERLAB_DIR may be omitted if they
    is the same as on the host where the code is generated)

    If the code is generated on a windows host, you will have to edit
    <model>_etl_hrt/<model>.mk and remove references to drive letters (e.g.
    C:\...) that Simulink Coder inserts automatically. GNU make chokes on
    these lines, so you are required to edit the file unfortunately.

Removing EtherLab

    First remove etherlab from matlab (this is not done automatically, not
    even when using package managers):
        - call /usr/local/share/etherlab/uninstall.sh $(MATLAB_ROOT)

        - From Matlab:
        >> pathtool
        remove references to etherlab. Save path.

    Now remove installation base:
        - package manager: remove EtherLab
        - source files: rm -rf /usr/local/share/etherlab
          
    Finished
