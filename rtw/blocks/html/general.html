        <h2>Common EtherCAT slave options</h2>

        Many slave options are common for all slaves. In this section the
        following options are discussed:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#master">Master</a></li>
            <li><a href="#slave">Slave Index</a></li>
            <li><a href="#model">Device Model</a></li>
            <li><a href="#vector">Vector Outputs/Inputs</a></li>
            <li><a href="#i_scale">Input Scale</a></li>
            <li><a href="#o_scale">Output Scale/Offset/Filter</a></li>
            <li><a href="#dc">Distributed Clocks</a></li>
            <li><a href="#sampletime">Sample Time</a></li>
        </ul>

        <a name="master"><h3>Master</h3></a>
        A numeric scalar representing the master that the slave is
        connected to.

        <a name="slave"> <h3>Slave Index</h3></a>
        A slave can be identified by its absolute position in the EtherCAT
        bus or by its position relative to another slave.

        <p/>The absolute position counter is incremented with every slave
        starting from zero with the first slave. If the bus topology changes,
        a slave's absolute position will be affected if the change was closer
        to the master.

        <p/>Slaves can also be addressed relative to each other. For this
        purpose, a slave's alias is used. This alias is a number that is
        permanently stored in a slave's non-volatile memory (see the
        <tt>ethercat alias</tt> command). Thus it is possible to identify a
        slave even after a power reset.

        <p/>Every time a slave with an alias is encountered during bus
        scanning, the alias counter is reset. Subsequent slaves can be
        addressed relative to this one.

        <p/>To enter an absolute address, simply enter the slave position as a
        numeric scalar. A relative address is entered as a vector
        <tt>[alias&nbsp;position]</tt>.

        <p/>Example:<br/>
        The <tt>ethercat slaves</tt> command can be used to show all
        slaves attached to a master device:
        <pre class="programlisting">
user@host:~$ ethercat slaves
0  0:0   OP     +  EK1101 ...
1  0:1   OP     +  EL4004 ...
2  0:2   OP     +  EL2624 ...
3  100:0   OP     +  EL4004 ...
4  100:1   OP     +  EL2624 ...
5  100:2   OP     +  EL1144 ...
6  100:3   OP     +  EL2624 ...
        </pre>

        In column 1 the slave's absolute position is shown. Column 2 shows a
        slave's relative addressing using the alias. Slave 3 has an alias of
        100 set.

        <p/>The slave at absolute position 5 (EL1144) can also be addressed
        relative to slave 3 that has an alias set. In this case, its address
        is <tt>[100 2]</tt>.  This relative address will not change if slave
        at position 2 (EL2624) is removed, for example. It will obviously
        change if slave 4 is removed.

        <p/>Examples of addressing slave 5 in the block's mask:
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Absolute Addressing:</td>
                <td><img src="abs-address.png"/></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Relative Addressing:</td>
                <td><img src="rel-address.png"/></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <a name="model"><h3>Device Model</h3></a>
        Select a device from the drop down list.

        <a name="vector"><h3>Vector Inputs/Outputs</h3></a>
        Checking this option groups the block's inputs and/or outputs to fewer
        ports.

        <a name="i_scale"><h3>Input Scale</h3></a>
        This value will prescale the input before it is written to the PDO.
        The effect of setting this is:
        <ul>

            <li><b>Empty vector</b> (e.g. <tt>[]</tt>): Raw input. Data type
            can be either Real32, Real64 or the PDO's data type</li>

            <li><b>Scalar</b> (e.g. <tt>0.1</tt>): The input port data type is
            forced to double. All inputs are premultiplied by the scalar
            value, where the result should be in the range [0,1) or [-1,1).
            This result is mapped to the PDO's domain [IntMin,IntMax]. The
            scaling value is available as a run-time parameter.</li>

            <li><b>Vector</b> (e.g. <tt>[0.1 0.5]</tt>): The input port data type is
            forced to double. The inputs are vector multiplied with the value,
            where the result should be in the range [0,1) or [-1,1). The
            scaling value is available as a run-time parameter.</li>
        
        </ul>

        Note: When the input is of type <tt>double</tt>, the PDO
        value is limited between its maximum and minimum values. There is thus
        no need to worry about the value wrapping.

        <a name="o_scale"><h3>Output Scale/Offset/Filter</h3></a>
        This setting is similar to <a href="#i_scale">Input Scale</a> 

        <p/>Setting any one of these values will cause the output to be of type
        <tt>double</tt>. The PDO value is then scaled to a value in the range
        [0,1) or [-1,1) for unipolar or bipolar outputs respectively,
        multiplied by the scalar value and adding the offset.
        
        <p/>LPF time constant of a low pass filter applied after scaling. The
        unit is [s]. (See <a href="#filter">deprecated use of frequency</a>
        below).

        <p/>All these parameter values are available as run-time parameters.
        
        <p/>If any one of these parameters are empty (<tt>[]</tt>), the
        specific operation is ignored. The corresponding run-time parameter is
        also not generated.

        <a name="filter"><h3>Deprecated LPF frequency (rad/s)</h3></a>
        The use of <b>LPF frequency</b> is deprecated because the
        implementation was misleading, changed when block sample time changed
        and inconsistent between continuous and discrete block sample time.
        Replace the block with a new one from the library and use <b>LPF time
        constant</b> instead.

        <p/>Continuous blocks (Sample Time = 0) just insert the inverse, i.e.
        <pre>TimeConstant = 1 / LPF_Frequency.</pre>

        <p/>Discrete blocks use 
        <pre>TimeConstant = BlockSampleTime / LPF_Frequency</pre>

        <a name="dc"><h3>Distributed Clocks</h3></a>
        Select the correct Distributed Clocks mode from the selection list.
        The last item <tt>DC Customized</tt> allows custom control of DC by
        being able to set values for:
        <tt>
        <table>
        <tr><td>AssignActivate</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CycleTimeSync0</td><td>CycleTimeSync0Factor</td></tr>
        <tr><td>ShiftTimeSync0</td><td>ShiftTimeSync0Factor</td></tr> 
        <tr><td>ShiftTimeSync0Input</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CycleTimeSync1</td><td>CycleTimeSync1Factor</td></tr>
        <tr><td>ShiftTimeSync1</td><td>ShiftTimeSync1Factor</td></tr>
        </table>
        </tt>

        <p/>The values of CycleTimeSyncX and ShiftTimeSyncX are in nanoseconds.

        <p/>These vector specifies the values for <tt>CycleTime0</tt> (ESC 0x9A0),
        <tt>CycleTime1</tt> (ESC 0x9A4) and <tt>StartTime</tt> (ESC 0x990) for
        the slave in nanoseconds and <tt>AssignActivate</tt> (ESC 0x980).

        <p/>The value for <tt>CycleTime0</tt> is calculated as:
<pre>if CycleTimeSync0 ~= 0
        CycleTime0 = CycleTimeSync0
else if CycleTimeSync0Factor &gt; 0
        CycleTime0 = BlockSampleTime * 1e9 * CycleTimeSync0Factor
else if CycleTimeSync0Factor &lt; 0
        CycleTime0 = BlockSampleTime * 1e9 / -CycleTimeSync0Factor
else
        CycleTime0 = 0
endif</pre>

        The value for <tt>CycleTime1</tt> is calculated as:
<pre>if CycleTimeSync1 ~= 0
        T1 = CycleTimeSync1
else if CycleTimeSync1Factor &gt; 0
        T1 = CycleTime0 * CycleTimeSync1Factor
else if CycleTimeSync1Factor &lt; 0
        T1 = BlockSampleTime * 1e9 * -CycleTimeSync1Factor
else
        T1 = 0
endif
CycleTime1 = T1 - CycleTime0 + ShiftTimeSync1</pre>

        The value for <tt>ShiftTime</tt> is calculated as:
<pre>if ShiftTimeSync0Factor &gt; 0
        ShiftTime = ShiftTimeSync0 + CycleTime0 *  ShiftTimeSync0Factor
else if ShiftTimeSync0Factor &lt; 0
        ShiftTime = ShiftTimeSync0 + CycleTime0 / -ShiftTimeSync0Factor
else
        ShiftTime = ShiftTimeSync0
endif</pre>
        The value of <tt>ShiftTime</tt> is used to calculate the start time of
        the internal clocks.

        <p/>Take particular note how the sign of factor chooses
        BlockSampleTime or CycleTime0!

        <p/>Usually it is a bad idea to use fixed times for cycle times
        (<tt>CycleTimeSyncX</tt>). Using factors
        (<tt>CycleTimeSyncXFactor</tt>) increases flexibility because it
        relates to the model's sample time.

        <p/>The values of <tt>ShiftTimeSync0Input</tt> and
        <tt>ShiftTimeSync1Factor</tt> are ignored and reserved for future use.

        <p/>Consult the EtherCAT documentation for further references
        regarding the meaning of these values.

        <a name="sampletime"><h3>Sample Time</h3></a>
        The <tt>Sample Time</tt> is either a scalar or a vector with two
        elements.

        <p/>The first value of a vector or the scalar value sets the block's
        sample time as follows:
        <table>
            <tr><td>-1</td><td>Inherited sample rate</td></tr>
            <tr><td>0</td><td>Continuous/fastest sample rate</td></tr>
            <tr><td>T</td><td>Discrete sample rate with period T</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p/>Data exchanged with slaves is organized in groups called domains.
        Every sample time in a Simulink diagram has at least one domain,
        domain<&nbsp;>0.

        <p/>The second element of a vector in this field specifies the domain
        identifier where a slave's data is grouped into.  The domain
        identifier is any positive number.  The domain is 0 if a scalar is
        entered for <tt>Sample Time</tt>.  The number of domains are
        practically unlimited.  However, a small overhead is caused by every
        domain.

        <p/>All slaves having the same key <tt>[SampleTime Domain]</tt> reside
        in the same domain.

        <p/>Domains can be used to manage slaves. The <b>Domain State</b>
        block in <tt>etherlab_lib/EtherCAT</tt> can be used to monitor if all
        slaves in a domain are present or not.

        <p/>Very rarely, some very simple unintelligent EtherCAT slaves cannot
        handle domains having both input and output PDOs (from other slaves of
        coarse). If the domain identifier is chosen carefully, a domain will
        only consist of the one or other PDO direction, enabling these slaves
        to be used.
